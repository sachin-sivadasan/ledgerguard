## Querying Subscriptions

### By Shopify GID

The most common method — use when you have the subscription ID:

```bash
GET /v1/subscriptions/{shopify_gid}
```

```javascript
const status = await fetch(
  `https://api.ledgerguard.app/v1/subscriptions/${encodeURIComponent(shopifyGid)}`,
  { headers: { 'X-API-Key': apiKey } }
);
```

### By Domain

Useful when you only know the store domain:

```bash
GET /v1/subscriptions/status?domain={myshopify_domain}
```

```javascript
const status = await fetch(
  `https://api.ledgerguard.app/v1/subscriptions/status?domain=cool-store.myshopify.com`,
  { headers: { 'X-API-Key': apiKey } }
);
```

### Batch Lookup

Query up to 100 subscriptions at once:

```bash
POST /v1/subscriptions/batch
```

```javascript
const response = await fetch('https://api.ledgerguard.app/v1/subscriptions/batch', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'X-API-Key': apiKey,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    ids: [
      'gid://shopify/AppSubscription/123',
      'gid://shopify/AppSubscription/456',
      'gid://shopify/AppSubscription/789'
    ]
  })
});
```

## Data Freshness

<Info>
  Subscription status is updated every time you sync your app in LedgerGuard. For most accounts, this happens every 12 hours automatically.
</Info>

| Scenario | Freshness |
|----------|-----------|
| After sync | Real-time |
| Between syncs | Up to 12 hours old |
| New subscription | Available after next sync |

You can trigger a manual sync from the LedgerGuard dashboard if you need fresher data.
