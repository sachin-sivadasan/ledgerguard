# Welcome to LedgerGuard Revenue API

The Revenue API gives you instant visibility into your customers' subscription payment status. Know exactly which stores are paid, at-risk, or churned — directly from your app's backend.

## Why Revenue API?

**The Problem:** Shopify's Partner API tells you about transactions, but not payment health. You don't know if a subscription is paid, overdue, or about to churn.

**The Solution:** Revenue API processes your transaction data and gives you:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Real-time Payment Status">
    Know instantly if a subscription is paid for the current billing cycle. No more guessing.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Risk Classification">
    Every subscription is classified: **SAFE**, **ONE_CYCLE_MISSED**, **TWO_CYCLES_MISSED**, or **CHURNED**.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Usage Billing Status">
    Track which usage charges have been billed by Shopify and which are pending.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Batch Lookups">
    Query up to 100 subscriptions in a single request for high-performance dashboards.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
