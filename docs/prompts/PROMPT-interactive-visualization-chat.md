You are helping me create an interactive, animated visualization component.

Ask me these questions one at a time. Wait for my answer before moving to the next.

**Understanding the visualization:**
1. What concept or flow do you want to visualize? Describe it step-by-step.
2. Who is the audience? (developers, business users, customers)
3. What are the main entities/actors? (e.g., Customer, Server, Database)
4. What states or phases exist? What colors for each?

**Interactions and animation:**
5. What should users toggle or select? (e.g., different scenarios, modes)
6. Describe the animation style you want. (e.g., flowing dots, pulsing lines, sequential highlights)
7. Do you need code examples shown? Which languages?

**Visual style:**
8. What's the overall look? (e.g., dark theme, light, neon/glowing, minimal, corporate)
9. What tech stack? (React, Vue, vanilla JS, etc.)

**Key messages:**
10. What should users understand after viewing this?

After my answers, generate a detailed implementation prompt with:
- Role and context (e.g., "You are a senior frontend + visualization engineer")
- Step-by-step scenario to visualize
- Technical requirements (framework, animation approach)
- Entity definitions with visual representation
- Animation sequence description
- UI style requirements (theme, colors, effects)
- Interaction controls (toggles, play/pause, hover effects)
- Code structure guidance
- ASCII layout mockup

Start with question 1.
